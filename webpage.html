        <h1>The Gym</h1>
        <p>I really like going to the gym, it's like a place for me to just relax and see myself getting 2 steps ahead from those who don't. I've going for the gym for about a year now and it was my best decission in life so far. Even though it takes lots of hour from my day i don't really care about it. The gym it's also a pretty good place to socialize, people are so nice there either young or old. Not the really big dudes, they really mean. But the things i most liek about the gym is realizing that i'm getting better and making myself healthier for the future. </p>
        <h2>School</h2>
        <p2>I low key enjoy being on school, not that i have to sit for like hours and learn stuff but i really like talking to people, i like to socialize with the kids in here and specially talk during class. I really like the people in here, but ot be honest, not all of them. I think some of them are really weird and odd, but still it is what it is. I also enjoy talking with my teachers because almost all of them are nice. The thing i most enjoy about school is getting in a class and just yap the whoole class. </p2>
